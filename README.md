A complete, DIY vehicle indicator system built for under Ksh 1,200. Designed for affordability, safety, and easy integration.

Overview

This is a custom-designed four-way vehicle indicator system aimed at reducing cost and simplifying installation for all vehicles, tuk-tuks, boda bodas, and budget fleets. Built with affordability and reliability in mind, this system replaces traditional vehicle indicators using basic electronic components and intuitive wiring logic, without sacrificing visibility or function.

Built entirely from off-the-shelf, affordable parts

Compatible with any 12V vehicle electrical system

Can be upgraded with relays or microcontrollers for automation

Tested and proven functional in real-world vehicle setup



Key Features

Four-indicator support: front left, front right, rear left, rear right

Works on 12V battery systems

Manual toggle switch control or relay-based flashing

Can be used with either incandescent or LED bulbs

Modular: can be expanded to include hazard flashing or smart logic

Compact and easy to install

Total cost: Ksh 1,200 or less



Advantages

1. Cost-effective: Significantly cheaper than commercial indicator systems

2. Simple design: Easy to understand, build, and troubleshoot without advanced tools
3.

Basic Logic:

Each side has an bulb connected via a switch

Switch connects 12V battery to the indicator

Arduino NodeMCU ESP8266 enables blinking (automatic on/off at interval)

Ground connections wired appropriately to chassis or negative terminal



Installation Guide

Connect PowerWire the system to a 12V source from the vehicle‚Äôs battery or ignition circuit.

Mount IndicatorsFix indicator LEDs/bulbs at the vehicle corners using adhesive or screws.

Install SwitchesMount manual toggle switches on the dashboard or handlebars for control.

TestPower the system and test each direction individually (left, right).

‚ö†Ô∏è Ensure wiring is insulated and safe to prevent shorts or fire hazards.



Demo

Include a short video or GIF showing the indicators blinking on a test setup or vehicle.



Future Improvements
